# WHAT IS CRYPTIFY?
Cryptify is a security application designed to provide complete

protection to users' digital assets. It offers a wide range of powerful

features, including File Encryption, Folder Locking, Drive

Encryption and Internet Access Control, all using Password or Face

Encryption. With Cryptify, we aim to provide the users a one-stop

solution for all their security needs. Cryptify is available for various

desktop platforms such as Windows, Linux and MacOS.

# PROJECT DETAILS
Cryptify is made using Python

and C++. Python's Tkinter is used to

create the GUI. Below are the features

of this app:

# File Lock
It enables the users to

completely encrypt any file of any

format. To achieve this, we use multiple

encryption algorithms to provide a

secure yet fast encryption.

# Folder Lock
It is done similarly as file

lock. The directory is first converted

to a compressed container, and then

our encryption is applied to it.

# Drive Lock
Here, we use Windows's

'Bitlocker' to encrypt a whole

partition, using a custom password

which the user provides.

# Lock Internet
This feature is to

completely block the internet access

from the user's machine at

Operating System level. The user can

use a password to lock/unlock.

# Mouse-Randomness Locker
This is a

special feature to use the

randomness in mouse coordinates of

human hand to generate an

extremely random encryption

feature.

# Face Encryption
This is the main highlight of Cryptify. All the

previously mentioned functionalities can be coupled with a face

encryption. It uses Python's 'Face-recognition' library to detect a face

and save it. Later it is used to compare the faces while unlocking.

To make it further secure and sniff-proof, we combine the password

encryption and Face Encryption to make the target full-proof against

any kind of attacks or security breaches. This deals with a lot of

aforeseen conditions where a low quality camera may fail to provide

accurate facial clarification.

# FLOW OF APP
The app has 2 usage modes: Offline and Online

# Offline mode
The user can access all locking featues offline and

the files cannot be unlocked on any other device even with the

correct password.

# Online mode
The user creates an account into our Database. The

locked files can only be decrypted with the correct password from

another device only if the user is logged into their account from

the other device.

# DEPENDENCIES
Requirements:

1. Windows 7+ (x64 Operating

System)

2. Webcam (Atleast 480p)

3. Python 3.9 (Only Needed for Face

Unlock)

Note: Our app auto-installs all

software requirements like Python.

The app also provides an option to

re-install requirements if anything

doesn't work as expected.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, Cryptify is a security application designed to provide complete

protection to users' digital assets. The app is made using C++ and Python

with Tkinter used to create the GUI.

It offers a wide range of powerful features, including file encryption, folder

locking, drive encryption, and internet access control, all using password or

face encryption. The app also has two usage modes, offline and online,

providing users with flexibility in how they want to use it.

The highlight of the app is the Face Encryption feature, which uses Python's

Face-recognition library to detect a face and save it. Overall, Cryptify offers

users a comprehensive security solution that combines different encryption

algorithms and security measures to protect their digital assets.
